# Project Summary

## Groq Agents

Groq Agents is a cutting-edge project focused on developing prebuilt, task-specific AI agents that run exclusively on Groq hardware. This project leverages the power of Groq's advanced AI models to create intelligent agents capable of performing a wide range of tasks efficiently and effectively.

### Key Features

1. **Predefined AI Agents**: Groq Agents come with a set of predefined agents designed to handle specific tasks. These agents are built to operate independently, requiring minimal user intervention.
2. **Master Agent**: The Master Agent orchestrates other agents to achieve predefined tasks. It can interface with various services, APIs, and SDKs to accomplish its objectives.
3. **Customizable Agents**: Users can create custom agents by defining their actions, parameters, and dependencies. This flexibility allows for the creation of agents tailored to specific needs.
4. **Tool Integration**: Agents can execute commands on a terminal, search for other agents, and interact with external APIs. This integration enables agents to perform complex tasks seamlessly.
5. **API Access**: The project provides public API routes for retrieving agent bodies based on their names or descriptions. This feature facilitates easy access and management of agents.
6. **Groq SDK Integration**: The project integrates with the Groq SDK, allowing agents to utilize Groq's powerful AI models. Users can select from various models to power their agents.

### Usage

To get started with Groq Agents, users can install the necessary dependencies, build the project, and utilize the provided `GroqAgent` class to interact with the agents. The API allows for easy integration and usage, making it simple to incorporate Groq Agents into various applications.

### Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```bash
npm install groq-agents
```

### Example Usage

```typescript
import {GroqAgent} from "groq-agents"

async function demo() {
    const agentClient = new GroqAgent("GROQ_API_KEY", "llama-3.3-70b-versatile")

    const agent = await agentClient.create("Write a poem for me", "You are a poet")
    const response = await agent.work()
    console.log(response)
}

demo()
```
